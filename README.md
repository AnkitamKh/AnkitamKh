<h1 align="center">Hello this is Ankitam</h1>
<h3 align="center">A hydrology and water resources enthusiast from NEPAL loves to who study how high altitude glacial fed rivers and streams responds to and are resilient to hydrometeorological extremes. I believe combining field-based measurements with remote sensing and numerical modeling is the best and optimum solution in order to understand river and floodplain dynamics across scales.</h3>
