<h3 align="center">A hydrology and water resources enthusiast from NEPAL loves to who study how high altitude glacial fed rivers and streams responds to and are resilient to hydrometeorological extremes. I believe that combining in situ measurements with remote sensing and numerical modeling is the best and most optimal solution for understanding river and floodplain dynamics across various scales.</h3>
